## Sunsetting Raven

One last note to let you know that we’re moving on for good to Google and shutting down the Raven apps on iOS, Android, Mac and Web.  

## What’s happening? 

As of today, your email will stop updating and any changes you make to it will not be reflected on any other platform. Tomorrow, you will be logged out of your account. Don’t worry though, all the information held in your email will still be available on the original platform you were using.

## What’s next? 

This is definitely the end of an era. But more importantly, it’s the beginning of a new one. We’re excited by what’s ahead and we’d love for you to come and join us in our latest adventure. We’ve kept our promise to bring the magic of Raven to the Gmail - and the Gmail inbox while we were at it - and we’re only getting started.  

To have a look at what we’ve been up to you, check out the latest email features we’ve released for Gmail on iOS and Android. You can also download the apps directly and try us out (you can find us here on iOS and there on Android).  

## This is it

We’d like to extend a final and massive thank you to all of you who’ve supported us along the way. It’s been a hell of a ride. We really hope you enjoyed those years we spent together as much as we did. 

With lots of love, 

The Raven team
