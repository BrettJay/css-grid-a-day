Today was another busy day at the office.

Before I knew it, it was already 1:30pm and I hadn’t grabbed lunch yet. I dropped by Brown Bagel nearby for a bacon and egg bagel.

After work, we headed to Lee Hoo Fook for a beer and some of their savoury pancakes.

A few beers later, we made a Chin Chin attempt, but the wait was too long, so instead, we made our way to Heartbreaker, and had beer and pizza for dinner.

We played a game of pool, and I set off to finish my CSS grid for the day.
