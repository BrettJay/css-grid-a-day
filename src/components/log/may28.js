We visited Maha for lunch today and had a 2-course meal. I chose a Vegan option and was very impressed with the food.

After work, we headed to Heartbreaker for a couple of beers. Somebody chose to play “Have a Cigar” by Pink Floyd on the Jukebox.

Afterwards, I went home, and spent the next few hours feverishly working on the eCommerce CSS grid entry.
