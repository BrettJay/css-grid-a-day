Today was the second-last day working out of the Melbourne office.

Things were off to a bit of a slow start, as I left my computer mouse and a few other supplies at the hotel. I dashed back to get them.

I continued work on video production and a few other tasks.

Went to Hardware Société for their excellent Baked Eggs Deux with potato and chorizo sausage.

I picked up some gifts in the evening from Miniso, and tonight I’ll probably be spending packing! 😅
