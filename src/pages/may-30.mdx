This past month has gone really quickly, all things considered.

In the past few years, I’ve been more mindful about keeping in the present, but also, putting an effort into collecting thoughts and memories.

Here’s a quick mockup of a journalling app I’d like to use, that so far, doesn’t exist (Day One is pretty nice, but for now my [low-fi][a] approach is working okay).

My brain is pretty fried these this past week, glad the end is so very nearly in sight, I don’t think I can keep this pace up forever!
