We emerged from our Hotel to find it lightly snowing.

Walking through the gentle snowfall, we made our way towards Karasuma subway station.

We rode the subway to Kyoto station.

Picking up an onigiri en route from a convenience store station, we eventually found our way to the JR office, and activated our JR pass.

We then used our pass to board a train bound for Arashiyama.
