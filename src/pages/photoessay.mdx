We emerged from our Hotel to find it lightly snowing.

Walking through the gentle snowfall, we made our way towards Karasuma subway station.

We rode the subway to Kyoto station.

Picking up an onigiri en route from a convenience store station, we eventually found our way to the JR office, and activated our JR pass.

We then used our pass to board a train bound for Arashiyama.

As we headed south towards Katsura River, it began to snow lightly.

Following the coast, we made our way west towards the monkey park.

Last time I’d visited, it had been closed due to snow. Today however, it was open for business.
      
We decided to make our way up the mountain.

We continued up the mountain, beautiful aerial views of Arashiyama coming into view as we continued our climb.
