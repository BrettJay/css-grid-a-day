    <p>An enjoyable film, carried by Ryan Reynolds and a very cutely rendered Pikachu. It’s tough to appeal to older fans, families, and kids, but Detective Pikachu mostly manages to stick the landing.</p>
    <p>Not a technically impressive film (well-rendered Pokémon aside), but one I still enjoyed a lot</p>

    <p>A satisfying ending to the first ten years of the MCU. Satisfying story that “subvert expectations” mostly successfully.</p>
    <p>Fanservice aplomb, for anyone who’s invested time into the cinematic universe.</p>

    <p>A visual and auditorily stunning, and disorienting character film.</p>
    <p>Successfully creates tension, panic, and a sense of disorientation.</p>

Last night I saw Detective Pikachu.

It was pretty good, with the qualifiers “for a Pokémon movie”, “for a kids movie”,  and “for a videogame movie”. The writing and acting were merely passable, but still made for a very enjoyable movie watching experience.

Contrast that with Avengers Endgame—a technically impressive, high budget film, that went above and beyond in fanservice and more—and yet, I just didn’t *enjoy* it quite as much.

Anywho, this isn’t for my trash takes. I don’t watch enough movies these days.
