Ah Todo lists. I would never be able to adequately adult without them. My todolist of choice is currently [Things 3][t] (though I have to say that [Taskade][ta] looks pretty nifty).

In this non-functional prototype, I wanted to explore the idea of having different to-do lists grouped together, a bit like Trello, focused on information density, allowing you to see outstanding todos across different focuses, without having to switch contexts (though some scrolling would be required).
