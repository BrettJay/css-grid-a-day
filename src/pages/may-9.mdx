Originally I had planned to just make a responsive menu example, going from a bottom tab bar on mobile, to a top navigation combined with the header for tablets and desktop.

Then I thought, *“Oh, I probably need to add a bit of content for scrolling, just as an example...”*

Before I knew it, I’d created a bit of an Instagram-like feed, figured I’d make it a follow-up to Milligram.

So... Introducing Milligram—the social network for posting coffee—that apparently, only I use.
