It’s looking cold rainy in Melbourne at the moments, I made a responsive weather app mockup, built with CSS Grid!

There’s a notion that many tech startups and services are created to cater to chores that developer’s mum’s used to do for them, and so I say, why don’t we go further, and create apps that can dress us?

I hate it when I don’t wear clothes for the weather, and I’m either too hot or cold.

So enter Wearthere—a weather app that tells you the weather *and also* what you should wear, so I don’t have to figure that second part out.

At a misguided attempt at inclusivity, this mockup includes an example of a setting toggle for people who *don’t* just wear shorts or jeans like me, but you may be able to tell that that’s all I wear.
