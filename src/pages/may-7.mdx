A demo blog admin built with CSS Grid, and rendering inputted markdown with Remarkable (blatantly lifted from an example on [Reactjs.org]).

I’ve been a [Markdown][md] fan for a long time. I love how readable it is in plaintext, especially when using reference style links.

Plus the tooling around it is great. Writing [blog posts][example] is so frictionless with static site generators like Jekyll, Middleman, and Gatsby working great with Markdown out of the box.

[I’m using][using] [mdx] on this project, and I’m quite liking it so far.
