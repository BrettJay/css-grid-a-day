Back in February, I used Middleman to prototype an [Itinerary application][a] for an upcoming trip to Japan.

It proved to be very handy while we were there.

Built over the course of a 3 hour flight from Perth to Melbourne, I refactored the code with React and Gatsby, and design with CSS Grid.

Adding a split view design so that you could navigate by day without having to change screen was an obvious improvement, made simple thanks to React’s state lifecycle methods.
