<Footer date={8} prev={true} next={true}>

The Mixin [farewell collage][m], recreated with CSS Modules and React components.

Admittedly, reusing some prior work, with some additional tweaks. I have to give credit for the original design to fellow Mixin organiser, [Kylie Timpani][kt].

This was my first experiment with CSS Grid back in the day, and really introduced me to some of what CSS Grid was really capable of.
